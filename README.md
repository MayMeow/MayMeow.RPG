ðŸ›¡âš” Web based online role playing game

## Motivation

Why RPG? Because role playing is fun and can bost your imagination and creativity. Mostly tutorials are about same: create blog, create link aggregator i wanted something else but wanted to learn most of language. This one is currently writeen with .Net Core 3.1. And now you can see how it's working One-to-One, One-To-Many, Many-To-Many (and self referencing too) relations between models. I have used ViewComponents and repositories pattern and more will come.
